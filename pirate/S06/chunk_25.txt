In the previous issue, we introduced concepts such as protocols and cryptographic protocols, and discussed the technical specifications of the IPSec VPN protocol based on national and industry standards for cryptography. We also interpreted the evaluation and verification methods of the IPSec VPN protocol through practical cases. In this issue, we will continue to explore with Dr. Yang the related content on the compliance verification of the IPSec protocol.

IPSec Protocol Compliance Verification
(1) IPSec VPN Device Protocol Configuration Check
When confirming the compliance of the IPSec protocol, one can start by checking the relevant configurations of the IPSec VPN device, such as encryption algorithms, authentication algorithms, and operating modes. This step helps to preliminarily confirm whether the device uses commercial cryptographic algorithms and protocols for data transmission. The following figure (Figure 1) shows the IPSec protocol configuration page of a certain IPSec VPN device, which includes the used cryptographic algorithms and operating mode.
