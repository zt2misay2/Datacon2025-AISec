You know that server response time exceeding 300 milliseconds (ms) can significantly impact your e-commerce website? If your website load time exceeds 500 milliseconds, you can lose 10% to 15% of visitors per second, and on mobile, this number rises to 25%. Furthermore, in recent months, there has been an exponential increase in network attacks, which threaten the maintenance of poorly maintained and unprotected content management system (CMS) ecosystems.
If you are an e-commerce professional and are not benefiting from professional and proven hosting service providers, your website may be prone to harmful short-term and long-term security vulnerabilities and lose money due to poor performance. The reasons are as follows: insufficient Time to First Byte (TTFB) - poor performance leads to search engine optimization (SEO) issues, as search engines always prefer websites with fast response times; poor user experience (UX) - page loading speed is crucial for reducing the number of users who leave the website due to slow browsing; backend operations waste time - server performance greatly affects the productivity of teams working in the store backend; legal liability - security vulnerabilities expose potential sensitive customer data, such as bank details, automatically making you violate the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR); lack of business continuity and recovery plan (BCP/PRA) - these plans are intended to restore your services in the event of physical server failures, hacker attacks, or critical errors that cannot be resolved within an acceptable time frame. Without them, your online sales may suddenly stop, sometimes even for a long time.
How to get support? Our partner TouchWeb focuses on Prestashop, Woocommerce and Magento environments based on OVHcloud bare metal infrastructure, providing high-performance and fully secure e-commerce websites to address these issues. TouchWeb also has a network of qualified professionals who support complex renovation projects for outdated CMS to give them new life. Since 2017, TouchWeb's AI has actively monitored over 400 servers and 200 e-commerce websites, with their clients' websites having an average TTFB below 300 milliseconds, sometimes as low as 19 milliseconds. Because your data needs to be stored unconditionally according to GDPR Article 32, their disaster recovery plan is guaranteed. Finally, in their proposed model, OVHcloud charges you directly for physical server costs, while TouchWeb only charges for their outsourced services.
This solution's key selling points are: cost-effectiveness - OVHcloud offers the best value for money with various products that meet the needs of all customers, and in the VSB/SMB market, it has the most efficient physical servers; not outdated - TouchWeb strives to provide the latest generation of servers offered by OVHcloud to ensure that you get the best technology at the optimal price; local data centers - there are 20 active data centers in Europe, 16 of which are in France, allowing elasticity without excessive costs. Since 2008, TouchWeb has supported over 170 customers with infrastructure migration and re-design projects, relying on OVHcloud bare metal infrastructure. With their internally developed automation tools, which have been developed over years, TouchWeb's expertise can achieve optimal performance and minimize your cybersecurity risks.
Currently, there is a wave of attacks targeting ESXi servers. Although no OVHcloud-managed services have been affected, many customers use this operating system on their own servers. Therefore, we provide this post as a reference to help them fix it. These attacks have been detected globally. According to experts in the ecosystem and authoritative institutions, malware may have used CVE-2021-21974 as an entry point. Investigations are still ongoing to confirm these assumptions. Our technical team is working to identify the detailed characteristics of the attack and coordinate with colleagues from other CERT and security teams.
Update 07/02/2023
We continue the investigation and provide support to our customers. We prioritize the following work: identifying affected customers on our network to provide the most accurate and appropriate information to help them recover from the attack; identifying vulnerable customers to ensure they take appropriate measures as soon as possible to reduce the risk when similar attacks occur again. Some security researchers may have already found a connection between Babuk ransomware source code (leaked in September 2021) and the attack. The encryption algorithm (Sosemanuk) was used in both cases, but the code structure seems slightly different.
In addition to the recovery procedures described earlier, we note that the encryption process only affects a small part of the data in the files. Depending on your virtual machine operating system and file system type, you may be able to recover at least part of the data using data recovery tools. Please note that these tools may irreversibly affect the files, so we recommend copying the virtual machine files to another location before attempting any recovery operations to protect the data. We have listed a list of companies that can help you recover data and rebuild the system. This list will be provided on the OVHcloud support page.
We also remind customers who are data controllers that they may have legal requirements to notify authorities in the event of a security incident. Ensure that you notify the appropriate authorities within the prescribed time frame. You can find the procedures for data breach violations in the main affected countries' data protection authorities and CERT websites below. Please consult your legal department or lawyer to ensure that you notify the correct organization according to your identity. For personal data controllers:

AppGuard and its partner Cipher participated in the FinCyber Today event on November 3, 2021. Cipher introduced cybersecurity threats lifecycle during the sponsorship presentation and demonstrated how to detect, block, and respond to network attacks. Overall, the conference invited well-known cybersecurity experts in the field to share insights and recommendations with attendees.
Lessons learned from countering ransomware attacks indicate that ransomware (perhaps more appropriately called extortion attacks) challenge the resilience of enterprise IT and security operations. Prevention and detection are only the beginning; restoring damaged systems is also a serious issue. Enterprises must examine their backup capabilities, with some enterprises needing more proactive backup strategies: continuous backups, hourly backups, or daily backups, etc. For example, the risk of critical task servers is much greater than that of ordinary employees' laptops. It is important to note that cybercriminals also target backups, so enterprises should seek immutable backups.
Collecting forensic data from affected endpoints can delay recovery operations, although they do not always identify the threat actor. If the response plan does not consider investigation time, it should be revised. The response plan should also be演练ed to enable faster execution and reduce irreversible errors.
Insights into the ransomware industry show that extortion attacks are increasingly carried out by increasingly complex criminal ecosystems, which include diverse supply chains and an increasing number of specialized roles and responsibilities. They are applying the lessons of the industrial revolution to become more profitable and resilient. Different experts handle different parts of the business, even with specialized consultants who identify valuable information from the vast amount of stolen data and those who sell these valuable pieces of information to buyers.
Like any business seeking to increase its income, this requires brand awareness and reputation. Individuals and organizations in this industry cannot completely hide in the dark web. Building their brand is crucial for convincing victims to pay the ransom. It confirms the commitment to the destructive consequences and the possibility of avoiding the consequences after the victim complies.
All industries are targets, and they will attack any opportunity target. Unfortunately, their tactics have evolved to no longer detonate harm on the first day. Instead, they install one or more backdoors, confirm remote access, and return when convenient. Remember professionalism, the people who gain access are increasingly not those who later return to monetize the intrusion results.
Numerous organizations now have timers in their ecosystems that will be activated later. All this specialization leads to more effective operations and attack techniques, making cybersecurity defense more difficult. Learn more about the challenges of detecting malicious software attacks and how incomplete detection increases IT and security operation costs from our blog.

Suggestions to improve the effectiveness of the Security Operations Center (SOC) first reflect on what makes running a SOC so difficult. First, detecting malicious activities is extremely difficult. A single tool is not enough. The SOC must integrate data from many different sources. Worse still, although helped by machine learning-enhanced tools, many talented analysts are still needed to investigate alerts. They spend most of their time on false positives, too much irrelevant information, too little relevant data, poorly optimized automation, organizational silos, and a lack of understanding of malicious techniques. Worse still, the attack surface is increasingly diverse and expanding. There are too many alerts, and too few analysts with large skill gaps.
Performance metrics sometimes shift the focus from the response proficiency for high-risk attack techniques to the efficiency of resolving work orders. This sub-topic is a big issue worth studying. Anton Chuvakin, one of the most respected SOC market analysts, has proposed many suggestions. Big data enthusiasts may be surprised to hear that one remedy is to address the imbalance between detection and prevention. One can never replace the other. And if one side is too few, it brings too much risk and too much SOC workload. If the number of alerts and data volume can be significantly reduced through more effective efforts, improving SOC operations would be much simpler.
Just like many other IT and security operation tools, SOC tools are created by developers but used by different operators. In feasible cases, rotating developers to operational roles can help achieve better automation components or widgets. Similarly, consider rotating policy/ rule creators and analysts. In the end, SOC can gain significant benefits from cross-team boundary rotations and continuous learning, making the SOC more adaptable, agile, and more effectively automated to amplify personnel power.
SOC can also benefit from redefining roles, reducing the rigidity caused by the definition of "first-level" and "third-level" analysts. Instead, "roles should be more aligned with an individual's skills and the use cases they are responsible for." For example, some people are better at handling suspicious application activities than lateral movement indicators.
Read this short article or the detailed white paper titled "Autonomous Security Operations, SOC's 10x Transformation" to learn more about Anton Chuvakin's suggestions for improving SOC.
How can AppGuard help your organization combat ransomware. Ransomware, like other malware, often evades detection techniques. This is not surprising. Malware can have almost infinite shapes and disguises. AppGuard is an endpoint protection software for Windows and Linux endpoints that complements existing detection-based protection. AppGuard is not a detection tool; it takes a completely different approach. This is why you should consider adding this lightweight tool. Read this blog post "Vulnerabilities in Enterprise Cybersecurity: Detection-Based Protection Is Not Enough" to better understand this issue.
