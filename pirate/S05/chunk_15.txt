The top ten mitigation strategies from the U.S. National Security Agency counter various techniques that APT attackers might use. These measures set priorities for organizations to minimize business impact and are built on the NIST Cybersecurity Framework functions, which aim to manage cybersecurity risks and promote a defense-in-depth approach. The strategies are ranked based on the effectiveness of known APT tactics, and additional strategies and best practices are needed to address new tactics as they emerge.

Assign privileges based on risk exposure and maintain them as required for operational purposes. Use Privileged Access Management (PAM) solutions to automate credential management and fine-grained access control. Another method of managing privileges is through tiered administrative access, where each higher tier provides additional access but to fewer individuals. Create procedures to securely reset credentials such as passwords, tokens, and badges. Controlling privileged accounts and services is essential to prevent attackers from gaining administrative access to high-value assets and moving laterally across the network.  
高管们应该了解如何减轻此类网络攻击的风险。当你阅读和听取关于这次攻击的细节时，你会听到关于SQL注入和身份验证绕过的信息。这些只是导致不幸结果的手段。无论哪种方式，对手都会劫持你基础设施中的关键应用程序，并用它来对付你。有一类安全控制措施，每个企业都应该全面使用：遏制和隔离。遏制限制了高风险应用程序对其所驻留的端点的其余部分可以做什么。隔离限制了端点的其余部分对同一主机上的应用程序或对象可以做什么或从中获取什么。  
AppGuard本可以保护受害者免受其被劫持的Kaseya VSA软件的侵害。AppGuard破解了在添加强大保护的同时避免执行期间应用程序控制困难的代码。没有哪个供应商能像AppGuard那样使遏制和隔离安全控制措施如此易于实施和维护，或如此有效。
