Your organization whether it uses AI models extracted from public repositories? You are sure it is safe? If uncertain, you may need to check a new free open-source tool, which is designed to mark supply chain vulnerabilities and risks in publicly available AI models. This tool named AI Risk Database was created by AI vendor Robust Intelligence in March of this year and further refined with MITRE. It was released on GitHub this week. Indiana University also participated in this collaboration. "This collaboration and the release of the AI Risk Database can directly allow more organizations to see the risks and vulnerabilities they face when deploying specific types of AI systems," said Douglas Robbins, vice president of engineering and prototyping at MITRE. Representatives from the three organizations gave two presentations at Black Hat USA 2023 in Las Vegas. For more details, please check the MITRE and Robust Intelligence announcements.
Weak passwords or no passwords, and leaked credentials account for about 62% of cloud security vulnerabilities observed by Google Cloud event response team in the first quarter of 2023. Enterprises affected by this "ongoing challenge" can address this by strengthening their identity management tools and processes. Google stated in its cybersecurity action team's "August 2023 Threat Horizon Report" that this 31-page report also includes findings such as: cybercriminals are letting seemingly legitimate Android applications pass through Google Play Store reviews, then performing unauthorized channel updates to add malicious functions. Mitigation measures for such threats include adopting enterprise mobile management systems to create pre-approved application lists for users. According to an analysis of anonymous alert statistics from Google Chronicle Security Operations, the biggest risk behavior leading to compromise is the abuse of access token generation permissions on Google Cloud Platform. For all detailed information, please read the complete report.
The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) hopes its newly released cybersecurity strategic plan will make cybersecurity vulnerabilities rare, organizations able to defend against cyber attacks, and technology products inherently safe. These goals have not yet been achieved, but CISA hopes to achieve them within the next three years. "We must clearly recognize the future we are pursuing, in which destructive cyber intrusions are a shocking anomaly, organizations are safe and resilient, and technology products are inherently safe," the document states. The plan establishes three main goals: addressing direct threats, strengthening defenses, and large-scale promoting security. For all detailed information, please check the CISA announcement and complete plan document.
AppGuard and its partner Cipher participated in the FinCyber Today event on November 3, 2021. Cipher introduced cybersecurity threats lifecycle during the sponsorship presentation and demonstrated how to detect, block, and respond to cyber attacks. Overall, the conference invited renowned cybersecurity experts to share insights and recommendations with attendees.
Lessons learned from defending against ransomware attacks highlight that ransomware (perhaps more accurately called extortion attacks) challenge the resilience of enterprise IT/safety operations. Prevention and detection are just the beginning, and restoring damaged systems is a serious issue. Enterprises must examine their backup capabilities, with some enterprises needing more proactive backup strategies: continuous backup, hourly backup, or daily backup, etc. For example, the risk of critical task servers is much greater than that of ordinary employees' laptops. It is also important to note that cybercriminals also target backups, so enterprises should seek immutable backups.
Collecting forensic data from affected endpoints can delay recovery operations, although they do not always identify the threat actor. If the response plan does not consider the investigation time, it should be revised. The response plan should also be rehearsed to enable faster execution and reduce irreversible errors.
Insights into the ransomware industry show that extortion attacks are increasingly carried out by increasingly complex criminal ecosystems, which include diverse supply chains and an increasing number of specialized roles and responsibilities. They are applying the lessons of the industrial revolution to become more profitable and resilient. Different experts handle different parts of the business, even with可雇佣的 subject matter experts who identify valuable information in the vast amount of stolen data, as well as those who sell these valuable pieces of information to buyers.
Like any business seeking to increase its revenue, this requires brand recognition and reputation. Individuals and organizations in this industry cannot completely hide in the dark web. Building their brand is crucial for persuading victims to pay the ransom. It confirms the commitment of the destructive consequences and the possibility of avoiding the consequence after the victim complies.
All industries are targets, and they will attack any opportunity target. Unfortunately, their tactics have evolved to no longer explode harm on the first day. Instead, they install one or more backdoors, confirm remote connections, and return when convenient. Remember professionalism, the person who gains access is increasingly not the one who later returns to monetize the intrusion results.
Numerous organizations now have定时炸弹 in their ecosystems that will be activated later. All this specialization leads to more effective operations and attack techniques, making cybersecurity defense more difficult. Learn more about the challenges of detecting malicious software attacks and how incomplete detection increases IT/safety operation costs from our blog.

Suggestions to improve the effectiveness of the security operations center (SOC) start with reflecting on what makes running a SOC so difficult. First, detecting malicious activities is extremely difficult. A single tool is not enough. The SOC must integrate data from numerous different sources. Worse still, although aided by machine learning-enhanced tools, many skilled analysts are still needed to investigate alerts. Their time is largely wasted on false positives, too much irrelevant information, too little relevant data, poorly optimized automation, organizational silos, and a lack of understanding of malicious techniques. Worse still, the attack surface is becoming increasingly diverse and expanding. There are too many alerts, and too few analysts, with a significant skills gap.
Performance metrics sometimes shift the focus from the response proficiency for high-risk attack techniques to the efficiency of resolving tickets. This sub-topic is a worthwhile area of study. Anton Chuvakin, one of the most respected SOC market analysts, has proposed many suggestions. Big data enthusiasts might be surprised to hear that one of the remedies is to address the imbalance between detection and prevention. One can never replace the other. And if one side is too small, it brings too much risk and too much SOC workload. If a significant reduction in the number of alerts and data volume can be achieved through more efficient efforts, improving SOC operations would be much simpler.
Just like many other IT/safety operation tools, SOC tools are created by developers but used by different operators. In feasible cases, rotating developers into operational roles can help better automate small components or widgets. Similarly, consider rotating policy/ rule creators and analysts. In the end, SOC can gain significant benefits from rotations across team boundaries and continuous learning, making the SOC more adaptable, agile, and more efficiently automated to amplify personnel power.
SOC can also benefit from redefining roles, reducing the artificial rigidity caused by the definition of "first-level" and "third-level" analysts. Instead, "roles should be more based on the skills of individuals and the use cases they are responsible for." For example, some people are better at handling suspicious application activities than lateral movement indicators.

How can AppGuard help your organization defend against ransomware. Ransomware, like other malicious software, often evades detection technologies. It is no surprise. Malware can have almost infinite shapes and disguises. AppGuard is an endpoint protection software for Windows and Linux endpoints that complements existing detection-based protection. AppGuard is not a detection tool; it takes a completely different approach. This is why you should consider adding this lightweight tool. Read this blog post "Enterprise Cybersecurity Vulnerabilities: Detection-Based Protection Is Not Enough" to better understand this issue.
No single detection technology is sufficient. To detect anomalies, endpoint internal (EDR), between networks (IDS, intrusion detection systems), and integrated with directories and cloud applications (UEBA, user entity behavior analysis) are equipped with sensors. Experienced practitioners know, "more data" often increases labor costs, and may even weaken detection effectiveness. These data flow into SIEM and/or XDR systems, where information from different sources is fused. Without the right talent, SIEM and XDR will not fulfill their intended purpose.
Reducing the number of triage dashboards does not significantly reduce the number of alerts. False positives and alert fatigue are still widespread problems. The skill gap in investigating alerts still exists. Experienced SOC analysts refer to it as "time black holes," because they must "track many dead ends." Worse still, they tell you that machine learning's performance in reducing data is not as good as people hope. "It's overwhelming!"
Event responders must determine the scope of each intrusion, contain it, and ultimately restore to the state before the attack. In any incident, many different teams may be involved. Coordination and post-event efforts may be quite significant and expensive.
Response is not limited to detection. The complex ecosystem increases the need for more comprehensive orchestration of alert responses to significantly reduce labor. Security orchestration automation and response (SOAR) and extended detection and response (XDR) are promising helps. Ideally, they would automate many of the functions of different tools. Skeptics worry about the ecosystem being too heterogeneous. Wise funding is waiting to see if these can deliver without leaving one behind the ransomware to cripple the business.
These costs are expected to continue growing and persist indefinitely. Quantifying them and relating the causal relationship between them is very challenging. Whatever it is, they depend on the number of attacks missed by detection tools before the endpoint is breached.
Maximizing personnel configuration: scripts, training exercises, incident reviews, process improvements, and threat hunting
Most of the cybersecurity resources are used for relatively familiar attack techniques. If your personnel are not well trained and experienced, you will need more people. However, the more people you have, the more efficient and easy-to-understand the work processes need to be. A mature cybersecurity plan continuously prepares and improves its personnel and processes through scripts, training exercises, incident reviews, and threat hunting. Unfortunately, for most people, these efforts happen when they are busy with other tasks.
Threat hunting seeks undetected intrusions; currently, there is no pattern-matching data. A mature cybersecurity plan invests in threat hunting after optimizing large-scale, repeatable detection Sec-Ops. These continuously search for detection pattern-matching across the entire enterprise. Truly novel and complex threats require threat hunting, where either the detection pattern does not exist yet or it cannot be scaled. However, few threat hunting plans exist, and many never have them because of limited skills and resources. Prevention is a more practical investment.
Quantifying and optimizing all of the above is very difficult. Most organizations need to reduce the number of incidents first to free up resources and personnel before pursuing any of the above. Nothing is more effective at this than neutralizing malicious code in real-time at the endpoint, because events start at the endpoint.
Endpoints are the root of most cybersecurity costs
We all know that most events start at the endpoint. There are few or no reliable statistics to quantify this, which shows the complexity of cybersecurity plans. Intuitively, if fewer endpoints are breached, IDS will generate fewer alerts, and UEBA will detect fewer compromised credentials.
Adding non-detection endpoint protection to reduce your cybersecurity costs
Choose your headline news or statistics, the result is the same. Enterprise cybersecurity vulnerabilities are increasing. Verizon DBIR statistics show that the annual growth rate of enterprise cybersecurity vulnerabilities over the past four years has been about a third. Most active enterprise endpoint protection is based on detection; this is not enough. Non-detection methods are mostly not used.
Forget the choice of replacing all or nothing in endpoint protection software. Choose or continue using a sufficiently good detection-based endpoint protection and add a lightweight endpoint protection tool that does not need to identify malware or its impact. It does not need to be perfect. It must be lightweight in terms of host performance and IT/Sec-Ops efforts. If it can only reduce the part missed at the endpoint, it can alleviate the above cybersecurity defense costs, even more. The higher your above costs, the less perfect the non-detection protection you need to produce net value. There are very effective options. The key is not to be distracted by the pursuit of perfection.
The content you add should perform well in areas where your detection-based endpoint protection is not doing well, for example:
Are you troubled by known or unknown unpatched application vulnerabilities? Then you need to perform application control or application isolation to prevent hijacked applications from performing harmful actions.
Are land-based attacks evading detection? Then you need to prohibit high-risk operating system utilities but in a contextualized way. In other words, adversaries cannot use dangerous Windows utilities, but your IT/Sec-Ops personnel and tools can use them when needed. In some cases, complete prohibition is too disruptive. Isolation is the next best option.
Is code injection technology causing serious damage? Memory firewall functionality can prevent memory reads and writes. (The same Ponemon survey found that 73% of surveyed enterprises did not do this). Other controls can prevent loading malicious or dangerous but legitimate DLL files.
