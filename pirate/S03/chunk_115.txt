A Practical Scenario
1. Background
We serve as a security service provider for the information center of a government unit, which comprises over ten business units, each with hundreds of information systems. All these system servers are located in a central server room, and the information center is responsible for their security supervision. While the information center has management rights over the network in the server room, the individual business units hold the management rights for their respective servers. Currently, due to various practical reasons, the business units lack basic management, let alone security management, for their information systems. Additionally, the information center lacks a mechanism for security monitoring, making it unclear which information systems and open services exist, which systems have security risks, and which new security vulnerabilities will affect them. To address this situation, we designed a comprehensive solution for the client, establishing a fundamental process from asset discovery to risk monitoring. This means conducting risk monitoring systematically based on real-time and reliable asset data. By reliable data, we mean, for example, port data: there should be no significant omissions, finding 99 out of 100 open ports; the data should be highly effective, with 99 out of 100 open ports being valid; the data should be highly accurate, with 99 out of 100 open ports correctly identified; and the data should be stable, always providing reliable results whenever accessed.
虽然大多数网络安全漏洞涉及技术问题，但网络安全最终还是一个人的问题。人为因素使企业面临风险，削弱了技术的有效性，但也可以弥补技术无法解决的问题。一些网络问题最好通过人性化解决方案或至少考虑人的状况来处理。我们分享了一些组织可以实施的专业提示，以减轻安全漏洞。这将有助于缓解网络安全计划中许多层级的工作量和压力

寻找暴露的杂项错误
根据Verizon DBIR 2019报告，“杂项错误”是金融、保险、教育、医疗保健、信息、公共管理、零售和技术服务领域前三大违规模式之一。专业提示：只有冗余的、主动的流程才能解决这些人为造成的症状。您的员工应维护并寻求“错误”Top 10/25/100列表，并与同行合作维护这些列表。优先处理高影响漏洞。寻找方法进行隔离以减少暴露

依赖专家进行渗透测试，而不是冒牌货
人们倾向于熟悉和舒适的事物。一些渗透测试人员从同一个技巧袋中抽取，而不是系统地针对整个可能的风险范围。许多企业难以区分专家和冒牌货。专业提示：利用威胁框架，如Mitre Att@ck。选择威胁情报提供商时，部分应基于他们如何从可能性缩小到可能性。除非确定其非常出色，否则避免使用同一家渗透测试公司。不同渗透测试人员之间的差异可能很大，一个可能发现其他人遗漏的漏洞。了解AppGuard如何与关键网络安全框架对齐，请参阅我们的最新白皮书

构建基于角色的网络安全培训计划
有效的员工网络安全准备培训可以减轻主要风险。给接待员和IT系统管理员提供相同的培训可能比不培训更糟糕。他们对风险（太低）和缓解措施（太高）的看法差异很大。集中培训很快会被遗忘，警惕性的暂时提高会回到粗心大意的状态。人的问题需要人的解决方案。专业提示：个性化员工网络安全准备培训。通过模拟钓鱼等手段挖掘数据，找出高风险员工。使用针对不同角色定制的内容。使准备成为一个持续的过程，教导、激励并强化

由于COVID-19危机，大多数员工预计将在传统环境之外工作。此外，随着远程工作因各种原因成为常态，组织可以利用这个机会建立适合传统和远程环境的强大网络安全态势。重要的一点是，网络安全挑战不仅涉及技术，而且以人为本的解决方案也是必不可少的。适用于一个组织的最佳方案可能并不适合其他组织
The top ten mitigation strategies from the U.S. National Security Agency counter various techniques that APT attackers might use. These measures set priorities for organizations to minimize business impact and are built on the NIST Cybersecurity Framework functions, which aim to manage cybersecurity risks and promote a defense-in-depth approach. The strategies are ranked based on the effectiveness of known APT tactics, and additional strategies and best practices are needed to address new tactics as they emerge.
Cybersecurity protection keywords: Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover
Update and upgrade software immediately
Keywords: Identify, Protect
Apply all available software updates, automate the process as much as possible, and use update services provided directly by vendors. Automation is crucial because attackers often study patches and exploit methods shortly after a patch is released. These "N-day" exploits can be as destructive as zero-day vulnerabilities. Vendor updates must also be genuine to ensure the integrity of the content. If applications are not patched quickly and thoroughly, attackers can carry out intrusions within the defender's patch cycle.
Secure privileges and accounts
Keywords: Identify, Protect
Assign privileges based on risk exposure and maintain them as required for operational purposes. Use Privileged Access Management (PAM) solutions to automate credential management and fine-grained access control. Another method of managing privileges is through tiered administrative access, where each higher tier provides additional access but to fewer individuals. Create procedures to securely reset credentials such as passwords, tokens, and badges. Controlling privileged accounts and services is essential to prevent attackers from gaining administrative access to high-value assets and moving laterally across the network.
