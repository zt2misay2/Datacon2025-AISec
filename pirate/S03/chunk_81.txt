KubeClarity is a specialized tool for detecting and managing software bill of materials (SBOM) and vulnerabilities in container images and file systems. It enables researchers to scan runtime Kubernetes (K8s) clusters and CI/CD pipelines, thereby enhancing the security of the software supply chain.  
The key features of KubeClarity include:  
1. A comprehensive dashboard that categorizes vulnerabilities by severity, displays detailed vulnerability information, and shows new trends.  
2. Application detection capabilities that support automatic detection of applications in the K8s runtime environment, as well as the creation, editing, and deletion of applications, along with the display of application details and associated vulnerabilities.  
3. The ability to view application resources such as packages, images, directories, files, and vulnerabilities.  
4. K8s runtime scanning, which can be performed on-demand or scheduled, and includes automatic detection of target namespaces and CIS Docker benchmarks.  
5. Command Line Interface (CLI) support for CI/CD, allowing the generation of SBOM using multiple integrated content analyzers like Syft and cyclonedx-gomod, and the scanning of SBOM, images, or directory vulnerabilities using multiple integrated scanners. Results can be exported to the KubeClarity backend.  
6. API support, providing an API service for integration and automation.
