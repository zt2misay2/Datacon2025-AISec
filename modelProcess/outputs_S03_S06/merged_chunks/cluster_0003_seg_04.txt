**01 CVE-2023-31039 Apache bRPC Code Execution Vulnerability**
Threat Level: High
Vulnerability Description:
On May 8, 2023, the Hua Yun An Si Jing security team monitored that Apache officially released a security update, disclosing a vulnerability in versions of Apache bRPC prior to 1.5.0. Apache bRPC is an open-source, industrial-grade C++ RPC framework, commonly used in high-performance systems such as search, storage, machine learning, advertising, and recommendations. An unauthenticated attacker could exploit this vulnerability to modify the ServerOptions pid_file parameter when the bRPC server starts, leading to arbitrary code execution with bRPC process permissions.

Currently, many online analysis articles focus on maintaining processor speed, which has become a higher priority than security considerations. Even the repair solutions from manufacturers are designed to avoid affecting device performance. Whenever a vulnerability is exposed, the speed at which vendors release patches is often criticized, and this situation is no different. For these two vulnerabilities, cloud users and IT administrators, in particular, need to pay attention and promptly apply the fixes.
