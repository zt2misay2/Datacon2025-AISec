作为潜在受影响服务器的管理员,我该怎么办?
首先,使用我们团队开发的工具(仅限Linux)检查您的服务器是否受到此漏洞的影响:
# wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/speed47/spectre-meltdown-checker/master/spectre-meltdown-checker.sh
# sh spectre-meltdown-checker.sh --variant zenbleed --explain
如果工具显示“NOT VULNERABLE”(未受影响),则您已经安全,无需进一步行动。
如果工具显示“VULNERABLE”(受影响),则应评估您面临威胁的程度。
The top ten mitigation strategies from the U.S. National Security Agency counter various techniques that APT attackers might use. These measures set priorities for organizations to minimize business impact and are built on the NIST Cybersecurity Framework functions, which aim to manage cybersecurity risks and promote a defense-in-depth approach. The strategies are ranked based on the effectiveness of known APT tactics, and additional strategies and best practices are needed to address new tactics as they emerge.

Update and upgrade software immediately
Keywords: Identify, Protect
Apply all available software updates, automate the process as much as possible, and use update services provided directly by vendors. Automation is crucial because attackers often study patches and exploit methods shortly after a patch is released. These "N-day" exploits can be as destructive as zero-day vulnerabilities. Vendor updates must also be genuine to ensure the integrity of the content. If applications are not patched quickly and thoroughly, attackers can carry out intrusions within the defender's patch cycle.
Secure privileges and accounts
Keywords: Identify, Protect
Assign privileges based on risk exposure and maintain them as required for operational purposes. Use Privileged Access Management (PAM) solutions to automate credential management and fine-grained access control. Another method of managing privileges is through tiered administrative access, where each higher tier provides additional access but to fewer individuals. Create procedures to securely reset credentials such as passwords, tokens, and badges. Controlling privileged accounts and services is essential to prevent attackers from gaining administrative access to high-value assets and moving laterally across the network.
