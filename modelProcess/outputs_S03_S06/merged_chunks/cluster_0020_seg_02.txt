In theory, after applying the patches and updates, everything should be fine. However, it's not that simple, as some unfortunate users have encountered additional problems. After the vulnerabilities were disclosed, Google stated that the currently released software repairs "have minimal impact on performance" and insisted that over time, the impact of the patches on performance would decrease. Intel also mentioned in its announcement: "Any performance impact depends on the workload. For general computer users, the impact of the patch on performance is not significant and will lessen over time." Due to the so-called Processor-Context ID (PCID) feature of the chips, these statements may hold true and ultimately be correct. However, more issues are still to follow.

The impact of the patches on device performance has already been evident. Although most ordinary desktop users and gamers have not noticed any delay, slowdown, or performance degradation, users running IO or system call-intensive software, such as databases on backend servers, might notice the effect of the patched CPU. Red Hat in the U.S. has set the range of the performance impact of the patches between 1% and 20%. Epic Games also explained last Friday regarding the recent login and server stability issues faced by players: "All our cloud services have been affected due to patching and fixing Meltdown and Spectre."
