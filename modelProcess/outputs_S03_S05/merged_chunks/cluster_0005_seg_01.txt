由于COVID-19危机,大多数员工预计将在传统环境之外工作。此外,随着远程工作因各种原因成为常态,组织可以利用这个机会建立适合传统和远程环境的强大网络安全态势。重要的一点是,网络安全挑战不仅涉及技术,而且以人为本的解决方案也是必不可少的。适用于一个组织的最佳方案可能并不适合其他组织
Vulnerability threat management is crucial because cybercrime poses a persistent global risk. Cybercriminals exploit any software vulnerabilities to gain access to networks and devices, leading to severe consequences for both developers and organizations. Users face the repercussions of such attacks, including ransom demands, data theft, legal issues, financial losses, and damage to their reputation. Developers should rigorously test code security, assess vulnerabilities, and fix them before release. Additionally, end-users must implement a robust vulnerability threat management plan to protect themselves from the destructive effects of cybercrime.
The Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) aids software developers and users in evaluating vulnerabilities and developing a strong VTM plan to ensure maximum system security.
Every year, an increasing number of software vulnerabilities are discovered, and cybercriminals are always ready to exploit these for their advantage. These vulnerabilities often result from coding errors, such as bugs or flaws, which allow attackers to inject or modify code, thereby gaining full access to the system's data. For instance, virtual contact center software developers may identify coding vulnerabilities before product release, or if found after release, they create patches to address them.
2023年7月24日,AMD发布了一份安全公告,披露了其Zen2计算机处理器微架构中的一个漏洞。该漏洞被AMD命名为“跨进程信息泄露”,也被称为“Zenbleed”。该漏洞被标记为CVE-2023-20593,并被AMD评为中等严重程度。此问题允许攻击者在特定情况下访问CPU处理的敏感信息。所有运行在基于AMD Zen2处理器上的软件,包括虚拟机、沙箱、容器和进程,都会受到影响。利用此漏洞的软件可能已经存在,预计基于此漏洞的攻击很快就会发生。
