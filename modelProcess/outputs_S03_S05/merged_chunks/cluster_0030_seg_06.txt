The higher your above costs, the less perfect the non-detection protection you need to produce net value. There are very effective options. The key is not to be distracted by the pursuit of perfection. The content you add should perform well in areas where your detection-based endpoint protection is not doing well, for example:
Are you troubled by known or unknown unpatched application vulnerabilities? Then you need to perform application control or application isolation to prevent hijacked applications from performing harmful actions. Are land-based attacks evading detection? Then you need to prohibit high-risk operating system utilities but in a contextualized way. In other words, adversaries cannot use dangerous Windows utilities, but your IT/Sec-Ops personnel and tools can use them when needed. In some cases, complete prohibition is too disruptive. Isolation is the next best option. Is code injection technology causing serious damage? Memory firewall functionality can prevent memory reads and writes. (The same Ponemon survey found that 73% of surveyed enterprises did not do this). Other controls can prevent loading malicious or dangerous but legitimate DLL files.
