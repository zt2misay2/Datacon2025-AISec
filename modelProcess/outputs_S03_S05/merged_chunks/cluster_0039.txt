There is a competition called AIxCC that aims to promote the development of AI-based cybersecurity products, offering up to $20 million in prizes. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is seeking public feedback on its draft CSF 2.0, which includes a new "governance" function. A new free open-source tool, the AI Risk Database, helps identify supply chain vulnerabilities in public AI models. Most cloud security vulnerabilities are caused by credential errors. The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) is working on a cybersecurity strategy to make security vulnerabilities rare and technology products inherently safe. Human factors are critical in cybersecurity, and organizations should focus on personalized training, threat frameworks like MITRE ATT&CK, and expert penetration testing to address vulnerabilities effectively.
