Like any business seeking to increase its revenue, this requires brand recognition and reputation. Individuals and organizations in this industry cannot completely hide in the dark web. Building their brand is crucial for persuading victims to pay the ransom. It confirms the commitment of the destructive consequences and the possibility of avoiding the consequence after the victim complies. All industries are targets, and they will attack any opportunity target. Unfortunately, their tactics have evolved to no longer explode harm on the first day. Instead, they install one or more backdoors, confirm remote connections, and return when convenient. Remember professionalism, the person who gains access is increasingly not the one who later returns to monetize the intrusion results. Numerous organizations now have定时炸弹 in their ecosystems that will be activated later. All this specialization leads to more effective operations and attack techniques, making cybersecurity defense more difficult. Learn more about the challenges of detecting malicious software attacks and how incomplete detection increases IT/safety operation costs from our blog. For more information on the ransomware industry, please watch Marutis Lucas's video from Intel471. Suggestions to improve the effectiveness of the security operations center (SOC) start with reflecting on what makes running a SOC so difficult. First, detecting malicious activities is extremely difficult. A single tool is not enough. The SOC must integrate data from numerous different sources. Worse still, although aided by machine learning-enhanced tools, many skilled analysts are still needed to investigate alerts. Their time is largely wasted on false positives, too much irrelevant information, too little relevant data, poorly optimized automation, organizational silos, and a lack of understanding of malicious techniques. Worse still, the attack surface is becoming increasingly diverse and expanding. There are too many alerts, and too few analysts, with a significant skills gap. Performance metrics sometimes shift the focus from the response proficiency for high-risk attack techniques to the efficiency of resolving tickets. This sub-topic is a worthwhile area of study. Anton Chuvakin, one of the most respected SOC market analysts, has proposed many suggestions.
