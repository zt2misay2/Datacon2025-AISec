The top ten mitigation strategies from the U. S. National Security Agency counter various techniques that APT attackers might use. These measures set priorities for organizations to minimize business impact and are built on the NIST Cybersecurity Framework functions, which aim to manage cybersecurity risks and promote a defense-in-depth approach. The strategies are ranked based on the effectiveness of known APT tactics, and additional strategies and best practices are needed to address new tactics as they emerge. Cybersecurity protection keywords: Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover
Update and upgrade software immediately
Keywords: Identify, Protect
Apply all available software updates, automate the process as much as possible, and use update services provided directly by vendors. Automation is crucial because attackers often study patches and exploit methods shortly after a patch is released. These "N-day" exploits can be as destructive as zero-day vulnerabilities. Vendor updates must also be genuine to ensure the integrity of the content. If applications are not patched quickly and thoroughly, attackers can carry out intrusions within the defender's patch cycle. Secure privileges and accounts
Keywords: Identify, Protect
Assign privileges based on risk exposure and maintain them as required for operational purposes. Use Privileged Access Management (PAM) solutions to automate credential management and fine-grained access control. Another method of managing privileges is through tiered administrative access, where each higher tier provides additional access but to fewer individuals. Create procedures to securely reset credentials such as passwords, tokens, and badges. Controlling privileged accounts and services is essential to prevent attackers from gaining administrative access to high-value assets and moving laterally across the network. 3 – Google:2022年的许多零日漏洞是已知漏洞的变种
在回顾去年在野外被利用的零日漏洞时,Google 发现大约40%的漏洞基于之前报告的漏洞。 这种现象背后的原因有几个,包括软件制造商有时没有完全修补漏洞,例如未解决其根本原因,这使得精明的攻击者可以通过不同的途径触发该漏洞。 “我们认为只有当补丁既正确又全面时,才是完整的。 正确的补丁是指以完全准确的方式修复漏洞,意味着该补丁不再允许任何对该漏洞的利用。 ”报告中写道。 Google 建议软件制造商在制作补丁时采取以下措施:找到漏洞的真实根本原因,而不仅仅是它被利用的方式;识别漏洞可能存在的其他位置;评估攻击者可能用来利用漏洞的其他路径;确定是否有绕过补丁的方法。 报告还指出,2022年有41个在野外被利用的零日漏洞,低于2021年的69个;在这41个漏洞中,17个是已知漏洞的变种;Android 用户通常需要等待“相当长”的时间才能获得针对零日漏洞的补丁。 (来源:Google 威胁分析组,2023年7月)
说到已知漏洞,美国和国际网络安全机构本周发布了一份联合公告,详细列出了2022年最常被利用的漏洞。
