Acalvio ShadowPlex
Category: Deception Technology
Deception technology is an emerging field, and simple and effective deployment technologies have often been at a bottleneck. Acalvio ShadowPlex sets an example in overcoming these technical difficulties. It provides customers with an unlimited number of deception assets, avoiding frequent maintenance and cost inputs. These deception points can be activated immediately when needed, locking onto attackers and continuously tracking them to obtain valuable threat intelligence. The tool then either conducts its own tracking or integrates with SIEMs like Splunk to remove the threats from the protected network. The top ten mitigation strategies from the U. S. National Security Agency counter various techniques that APT attackers might use. These measures set priorities for organizations to minimize business impact and are built on the NIST Cybersecurity Framework functions, which aim to manage cybersecurity risks and promote a defense-in-depth approach. The strategies are ranked based on the effectiveness of known APT tactics, and additional strategies and best practices are needed to address new tactics as they emerge.

Update and upgrade software immediately
Keywords: Identify, Protect
Apply all available software updates, automate the process as much as possible, and use update services provided directly by vendors. Automation is crucial because attackers often study patches and exploit methods shortly after a patch is released. These "N-day" exploits can be as destructive as zero-day vulnerabilities. Vendor updates must also be genuine to ensure the integrity of the content. If applications are not patched quickly and thoroughly, attackers can carry out intrusions within the defender's patch cycle. Secure privileges and accounts
Keywords: Identify, Protect
Assign privileges based on risk exposure and maintain them as required for operational purposes. Use Privileged Access Management (PAM) solutions to automate credential management and fine-grained access control. Another method of managing privileges is through tiered administrative access, where each higher tier provides additional access but to fewer individuals. Create procedures to securely reset credentials such as passwords, tokens, and badges.
