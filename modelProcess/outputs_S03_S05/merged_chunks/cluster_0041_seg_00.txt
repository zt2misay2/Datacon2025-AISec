Acalvio ShadowPlex provides an example of overcoming technical difficulties in deception technology, offering unlimited deception assets and integrating with SIEMs like Splunk to track and remove threats. The article also discusses the importance of endpoint protection, emphasizing that most cybersecurity costs stem from endpoints and that non-detection methods can reduce these costs. Additionally, it highlights the role of AI risk databases in identifying supply chain vulnerabilities and the need for robust identity management to address weak passwords and leaked credentials. The 2023 Threat Horizon Report by Google notes that malicious Android apps often bypass Google Play's review process, and that cross-project abuse of Google Cloud Platform access tokens is a major risk. CISA's cybersecurity strategy aims to make cybersecurity vulnerabilities rare and technologies inherently secure, focusing on three main goals: addressing direct threats, strengthening defenses, and large-scale promotion of security. The article also discusses the challenges of false positives and alert fatigue, the importance of SOAR and XDR in reducing labor costs, and the need for optimized threat hunting and endpoint protection. Finally, it emphasizes that most cybersecurity resources are spent on familiar attack techniques, and that non-detection methods can be more effective in reducing costs without perfect detection.
