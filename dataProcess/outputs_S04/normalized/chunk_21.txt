The average cost of a breach in 2021 reached a 17-year high, with 10% of breaches caused by ransomware—a figure that is double that of 2020, according to the *IBM Cost of a Data Breach Report 2021*. Recently, Gartner released a toolkit for responding to cybersecurity incidents, reminding security and risk managers to be prepared and plan ahead for such events. Below are the three essential tools emphasized by Gartner this time.
Develop an Incident Response Plan
A general plan for responding to cyber incidents should include the following:
- Map out the response process. The incident response plan should specify detailed steps to follow in an orderly manner when an incident occurs. The incident owner (or a similar role) should ensure that all steps are fully implemented and track progress and communication on a rolling basis.
- Define incident severity levels. All security incidents must be classified and assigned a severity level. This helps guide incident escalation, clarify service level agreements, and inform stakeholders of the potential or actual impact on the organization in other ways. Severity levels also determine who should be notified, the escalation path, and which playbooks to use.
- Clarify responsibilities. Effective incident response requires teamwork. The RACI model can clearly define all roles and corresponding responsibilities related to incident response across the entire organization. Common stakeholders include C-suite, legal, privacy, and HR teams.
Founded in 2016 and headquartered in Washington, WireWheel is dedicated to simplifying the construction of data privacy protection compliance capabilities, helping companies deal with complex and stringent laws and regulations. In October 2018, the company received a $10 million Series A financing round led by PSP Growth.
According to the Breach Level Index report published by digital security company Gemalto in October 2018, there were 945 data breaches in the first half of 2018, resulting in the exposure of 4.5 billion records. To strengthen consumer privacy rights and data security, the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) have been enacted and passed. Many companies, lacking awareness and capability for user privacy and data protection, urgently need to respond to various compliance requirements or face severe penalties. The data privacy security company BigID won the RSAC 2018 Innovation Sandbox, and this year’s Innovation Sandbox also focuses on innovation in the field of data privacy, indicating a strong demand for innovation in data privacy protection in the security sector.
Privacy protection and data security have become important components of corporate security capability building. However, enhancing data privacy protection in a complex IT system environment poses a significant challenge to traditional data loss prevention technologies and products, adding a heavy burden to corporate data management. Large enterprises, with their complex internal network environments and data storage architectures, require technical support across multiple stages such as data discovery, management, and classification for effective data privacy protection. Data collaboration and sharing among multiple departments necessitate the correlation and aggregation analysis of data to more reasonably identify potential privacy leak risks.
