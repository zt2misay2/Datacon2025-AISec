When designing security features for a product or conducting security testing, we often wonder about the boundaries of security feature design and whether there are overlaps. We also consider the key points that security testing should focus on, and if the testing is comprehensive enough to cover all potential attack vectors. In the field of security, due to the asymmetry between offense and defense, new attack methods keep emerging, putting defenders in a passive position. This raises the question of how to reasonably perform threat modeling for a product. Ultimately, these questions boil down to evaluating the quality of the product design and identifying areas that need improvement. In this article, we will use the ATT&CK model as an example to examine product security from a new perspective.
