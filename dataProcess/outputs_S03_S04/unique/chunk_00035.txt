The full name of GDPR is the General Data Protection Regulation. This legislation was drafted in January 2012, and after four years of discussion and negotiation, the EU officially passed this regulation and announced a trial run in April 2016. It came into full effect on May 25, 2018. Due to the GDPR stipulation that companies can face fines of up to 4% of their global turnover for violations, it has been dubbed the "strictest data protection regulation in history." Previously, major data breach incidents in 2017 and the recent scandal involving Facebook and Cambridge Analytica's collection of user data were all secretly relieved that they did not encounter the official implementation of GDPR; otherwise, their situations would have been even more severe. What kind of waves will such a legal regulation cause globally after its formal implementation? The author will provide a rough interpretation from the content of the GDPR, its scope of application, and the reactions of several major enterprises. You know that server response time exceeding 300 milliseconds (ms) can seriously affect your e-commerce website? If your website loading time exceeds 500 milliseconds, you will lose 10% to 15% of visitors per second, and on mobile devices, this number rises to 25%. Additionally, in recent months, there has been an exponential increase in network attacks, which threaten the maintenance of inadequate and unprotected content management systems (CMS) ecosystems. If you are an e-commerce professional and have not benefited from the services of a professional and verified hosting service provider, your website may be prone to harmful short-term and long-term security vulnerabilities and may lose money due to poor performance. The reasons are as follows: insufficient Time to First Byte (TTFB) - poor performance leads to search engine optimization (SEO) problems, as search engines always prefer websites with fast response times; poor user experience (UX) - page loading speed is crucial for reducing the number of users who leave the website due to slow browsing; backend operations waste time - server performance greatly affects the productivity of teams working in the store backend; criminal responsibility - security vulnerabilities expose potential sensitive customer data, such as bank details, automatically making you violate the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR); lack of business continuity and recovery plans (BCP/PRA) - these plans are designed to restore your services in the event of physical server failures, hacker attacks, or critical errors that cannot be resolved within an acceptable time frame. If you do not have them, your online sales may suddenly stop, sometimes for a long time. How can you get support? Our partner TouchWeb focuses on Prestashop, Woocommerce, and Magento environments based on OVHcloud bare metal infrastructure, providing high-performance and fully secure e-commerce websites to address these issues. TouchWeb also has a network of qualified professionals who support complex renovation projects for outdated CMS to give them new life. Since 2017, TouchWeb's AI has actively monitored over 400 servers and 200 e-commerce websites, with their clients' websites having an average TTFB below 300 milliseconds, sometimes as low as 19 milliseconds. Because your data needs to be stored unconditionally according to GDPR Article 32, their disaster recovery plan is guaranteed. Finally, in their proposed model, OVHcloud charges you directly for physical server costs, while TouchWeb charges only for its outsourced services.

With its internally developed automation tools, which have been developed over many years, TouchWeb's expertise can achieve optimal performance and minimize your cybersecurity risks. PSD3 and PSR changes: everything banks need to know PSD3 is coming. In June 2023, the European Commission outlined its proposed updates to PSD2, actually ushering in the PSD3 era. At the same time, the UK payment system regulator (PSR) has also introduced new details for its proposal, providing more comprehensive protection for customers who have been victims of fraud. Reviewing PSD2 and SCA Before delving into PSD3 and PSR, let's quickly review PSD2. PSD2 aims to promote greater competition between banks and non-bank organizations by balancing the two. Strong Customer Authentication (SCA) is a key component of the entire regulatory framework, aimed at reducing fraud. A retrospective review by the European Commission concluded that SCA has had a positive overall impact on reducing unauthorized fraud. However, an unintended consequence of SCA is that it allows other types of fraud to appear, such as fraud. In the European market, fraud is typically referred to as impersonation. Impersonation refers to scammers contacting victims and persuading them to authorize transactions on their behalf. This presents new challenges for banks in protecting customers and better detecting fraudulent transactions. PSD3 seeks to address some of these challenges. Five key principles of PSD3 The PSD3 includes five key principles: IBAN-Name Verification These principles' first is IBAN-Name Verification. For those familiar with the UK paymentor verification model, this proposal is very similar. It allows customers to verify the person they are paying by sending communication between the bank and the receiving bank. If there is a mismatch, the customer can be warned and may avoid fraud when the fraud occurs. Enhanced data sharing The second principle is a legal basis and framework that allows banks to share data more efficiently. In many parts of the world, banks have recognized the scale of fraud and impersonation. They recognize that fraudsters exchange and share best practices. Now people realize that if banks want to stay ahead of fraudsters, they need to follow these principles. The ability to share known bad data, such as known money transfer accounts or high-risk beneficiaries, will ultimately enable all sizes of financial services organizations to make better risk decisions when transactions occur. Enhanced fraud monitoring The third principle is that banks are required to improve their performance from the perspective of fraud transaction monitoring. It is unclear what this requirement means until more details are published. However, a possible result is that banks will be forced to move from rule-based fraud detection methods to more reliance on automated machine learning detection methods. Customer and employee education The fourth principle involves the education of consumers and employee members. It is widely believed that customer education is a key pillar of any fraud and impersonation prevention strategy. Banks will have to do more in this area. We see banks moving away from traditional education awareness, with customers having to find best practices and guidance themselves. We see banks incorporating these pieces of information explicitly into the user journey during transactions. This education, if done correctly, can enable banks to make customers the first line of defense against fraud and may prevent customers from making transactions even before they reach the bank's fraud system. Employee training is also a key part of PSD3. Banks must ensure that their employees understand the latest fraud trends and remain credible and knowledgeable when customers seek advice. Enhanced customer refund rights The fifth, perhaps most important principle is that if a customer becomes a victim of impersonation fraud, they will have stronger refund rights. Currently, there is no law in the EU that requires customers who become victims of impersonation fraud to be compensated. PSD3 aims to provide some enhanced consumer protection for certain types of impersonation. It is important to note that regulations specify that only when a victim is a victim of impersonation fraud are they entitled to compensation. This leaves questions about investment fraud, romance fraud, and other types of fraud that are widely present in the market. The second regulation is that if the IBAN-Name Verification service fails, they may be entitled to a refund. However, we will wait for further details to understand the exact meaning of errors in this process. Banks face increased risk exposure This is important for banks because their risk exposure will significantly increase. Currently, they do not provide these refunds. In the future, they will have to take on this responsibility. This means they will have to find fraud budgets that they have not had before. Therefore, we expect them to double their efforts in detection and technology to offset some of the risks associated with this new set of regulations. PSR-enhanced fraud protection Returning to PSR, there are obvious similarities to what I described in PSD3. The concept of PSR is that if someone becomes a victim of fraud, it provides enhanced consumer protection. In principle, this means more frequent refunds. This also means that the responsibility is shared between the sending bank and the receiving bank. This shared responsibility incentivizes both parties to do more work in consumer protection and fraud detection. As the April deadline approaches, more details of the policy are beginning to emerge. For example, we now know that the initial £100 minimum limit for claims has been removed, and anyone who becomes a victim of fraud is eligible for a refund, regardless of the amount lost. We also know that in the short term, only instant payment types of transactions are included in the refund. This excludes fraud that occurs through cash loss or international transactions. The logic is that data analysis shows that currently 97% of fraud occurs through instant payment channels. Other payment types, such as CHAPS, will be considered in future policy iterations.
