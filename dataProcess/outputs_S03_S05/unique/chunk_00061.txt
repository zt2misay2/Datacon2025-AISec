In this article, we start from Gartner's definition of threat intelligence and explore the several components it involves: context, indicators, and actionable advice.
Data, Information, and Intelligence
The threat intelligence provider Recorded Future once wrote an article to analyze the differences between data, information, and intelligence. If interested, you can read it by visiting the link in the reference resources. Compared to many articles that borrow heavily from military and business fields, making threat intelligence seem obscure, Recorded Future's article is more grounded in cybersecurity. In my opinion, the mainstream application scenarios of threat intelligence combined with SOC/SIEM are far from comparable to military intelligence. First, we need to thoroughly collect and clean up multi-dimensional data. Only after completing these tedious and exhausting tasks and building the superstructure on top of them can we have a truly reliable foundation.
Among the concepts of data, information, and intelligence, the definition of data is relatively clear, which can be understood as a record of a large number of independent objective facts. Information and intelligence, on the other hand, are different levels of conclusions obtained based on the processing of data. The following diagram, widely cited, expresses a basic process and relationship:
However, the distinction between information and intelligence is quite subtle. After reading various articles attempting to explain their differences, I still cannot draw a clear line between them. From the perspective of usefulness and inheritance, let me put down the entanglement for a moment with a very inappropriate analogy: data can be seen as poppies, information as opium, and intelligence as heroin.
