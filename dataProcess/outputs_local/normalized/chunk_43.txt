Recently, NIST released the "Cybersecurity Supply Chain Risk Management Practices for Systems and Organizations." This document outlines best practices since the U.S. government's supply chain security strategy was introduced in 2019, offering implementation methods and a roadmap for managing supply chain security. Concurrently, MITRE, an official U.S. think tank, has introduced its Supply Chain Security System of Trust (SoTTM) framework, which is prominently featured in the NIST document and promoted as the primary architecture for supply chain security management within the industry. After extensive investigation and data compilation, U.S. institutions have proposed a technical roadmap and security architecture for supply chain security, providing significant reference value for China's research on this topic.
