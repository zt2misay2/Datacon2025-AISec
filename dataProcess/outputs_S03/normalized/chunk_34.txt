When designing security features for a product or conducting security testing, we often wonder about the boundaries of security feature design and whether there are overlaps. We also consider the key points that security testing should focus on, and if the testing is comprehensive enough to cover all potential attack vectors. In the field of security, due to the asymmetry between offense and defense, new attack methods keep emerging, putting defenders in a passive position. This raises the question of how to reasonably perform threat modeling for a product. Ultimately, these questions boil down to evaluating the quality of the product design and identifying areas that need improvement. In this article, we will use the ATT&CK model as an example to examine product security from a new perspective.
Although most cybersecurity vulnerabilities involve technical issues, cybersecurity ultimately is a human issue. Human factors expose enterprises to risks, weakening the effectiveness of technology but also compensating for problems that technology cannot solve. Some network issues are best addressed with human-centered solutions or at least consider the condition of people. We share some professional tips that organizations can implement to alleviate security vulnerabilities. This will help reduce the workload and pressure at many levels of a cybersecurity plan.

Looking for exposed miscellaneous errors
According to the Verizon DBIR 2019 report, "miscellaneous errors" are one of the top three incident patterns in the financial, insurance, education, healthcare, information, public administration, retail, and technology service sectors. Professional tip: Only redundant, proactive processes can resolve these human-caused symptoms. Your employees should maintain and seek "error" top 10/25/100 lists and collaborate with peers to maintain these lists. Prioritize high-impact vulnerabilities. Look for methods to isolate to reduce exposure.
Hire experts for penetration testing, not impostors. People tend to favor familiar and comfortable things. Some penetration testers draw from the same trick bag rather than systematically targeting the entire possible risk range. Many companies find it difficult to distinguish experts from impostors. Professional tip: Use threat frameworks, such as Mitre Att&CK. When choosing threat intelligence providers, part should be based on how they narrow down possibilities to possibilities. Avoid using the same penetration testing company unless it is determined to be exceptionally outstanding. Differences between penetration testers may be significant; one may find vulnerabilities that others have overlooked.

Build role-based cybersecurity training programs. Effective employee cybersecurity preparedness training can mitigate major risks. Giving receptionists and IT system administrators the same training may be worse than not training them. They have greatly different views on risks (too low) and mitigation measures (too high). Concentrated training is quickly forgotten, and temporary increases in vigilance return to carelessness. Human issues require human solutions. Professional tip: Personalize employee cybersecurity preparedness training. Use simulations like phishing to dig for data, identify high-risk employees. Use content customized for different roles. Make preparedness a continuous process, teach, motivate, and reinforce.
Due to the COVID-19 crisis, most employees are expected to work outside traditional environments. Additionally, as remote work has become the norm for various reasons, organizations can use this opportunity to build a strong cybersecurity posture that is suitable for traditional and remote environments. An important point is that cybersecurity challenges involve not only technology but also human-centered solutions. The best solution for one organization may not be suitable for others.
This article represents the views of CSO, a news media platform under IDG Consulting. Security threats are constantly evolving and tend to follow trends. As long as a certain type of threat is highly successful and profitable, cybercriminals will imitate it. Therefore, the best defense is to identify these threat trends and take the initiative in threat detection. In line with this perspective, Gartner rated the "Top 11 Information Security Technologies for 2017" in June. We focused on the hottest technology categories mentioned by Gartner for 2017, delved into the latest cybersecurity products and services, and selected 22 of the most innovative and practical products for 2017. These products have all been tested in local test platforms or production environments provided by the vendors. They address some of the most destructive security threats currently. The following products are listed in alphabetical order.
