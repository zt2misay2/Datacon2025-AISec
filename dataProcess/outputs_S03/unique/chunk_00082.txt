When designing security features for a product or conducting security testing, we often wonder about the boundaries of security feature design and whether there are overlaps. We also consider the key points that security testing should focus on, and if the testing is comprehensive enough to cover all potential attack vectors. In the field of security, due to the asymmetry between offense and defense, new attack methods keep emerging, putting defenders in a passive position. This raises the question of how to reasonably perform threat modeling for a product. Ultimately, these questions boil down to evaluating the quality of the product design and identifying areas that need improvement. In this article, we will use the ATT&CK model as an example to examine product security from a new perspective. ATT&CK, which stands for Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge, is a framework first proposed by MITRE Corporation in 2013. It is based on the Cyber Kill Chain and serves as a knowledge base and model used to describe attack behaviors, reflecting the objectives of attackers at various stages of the attack lifecycle. The ATT&CK framework describes an attack matrix through three core elements (TTPs): tactics, techniques, and procedures. Tactics represent the short-term goals of the attacker, techniques describe the methods used by the attacker to achieve tactical goals, and procedures are the specific use cases of the techniques by the attacker. Based on the diversity of the evaluated objects, there are three types of attack matrices on the MITRE website, each mapping to different platforms: Enterprise for Linux, macOS, and Windows; Mobile for mobile devices; and ICS for industrial control systems.
