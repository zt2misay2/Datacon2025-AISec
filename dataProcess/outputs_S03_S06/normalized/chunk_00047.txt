Currently, many online analysis articles focus on maintaining processor speed, which has become a higher priority than security considerations. Even the repair solutions from manufacturers are designed to avoid affecting device performance. Whenever a vulnerability is exposed, the speed at which vendors release patches is often criticized, and this situation is no different. For these two vulnerabilities, cloud users and IT administrators, in particular, need to pay attention and promptly apply the fixes.
In theory, after applying the patches and updates, everything should be fine. However, it's not that simple, as some unfortunate users have encountered additional problems. After the vulnerabilities were disclosed, Google stated that the currently released software repairs "have minimal impact on performance" and insisted that over time, the impact of the patches on performance would decrease. Intel also mentioned in its announcement: "Any performance impact depends on the workload. For general computer users, the impact of the patch on performance is not significant and will lessen over time." Due to the so-called Processor-Context ID (PCID) feature of the chips, these statements may hold true and ultimately be correct. However, more issues are still to follow.
The impact of the patches on device performance has already been evident. Although most ordinary desktop users and gamers have not noticed any delay, slowdown, or performance degradation, users running IO or system call-intensive software, such as databases on backend servers, might notice the effect of the patched CPU. Red Hat in the U.S. has set the range of the performance impact of the patches between 1% and 20%. Epic Games also explained last Friday regarding the recent login and server stability issues faced by players: "All our cloud services have been affected due to patching and fixing Meltdown and Spectre."
2023年7月24日,AMD发布了一份安全公告,披露了其Zen2计算机处理器微架构中的一个漏洞。该漏洞被AMD命名为“跨进程信息泄露”,也被称为“Zenbleed”。该漏洞被标记为CVE-2023-20593,并被AMD评为中等严重程度。此问题允许攻击者在特定情况下访问CPU处理的敏感信息。所有运行在基于AMD Zen2处理器上的软件,包括虚拟机、沙箱、容器和进程,都会受到影响。利用此漏洞的软件可能已经存在,预计基于此漏洞的攻击很快就会发生。
All AMD Zen2 CPU, including EPYC Rome processors, have this vulnerability, specifically including:
- AMD Ryzen 3000 series processors
- AMD Ryzen PRO 3000 series processors
- AMD Ryzen Threadripper 3000 series processors
- AMD Ryzen 4000 series processors with Radeon graphics
- AMD Ryzen PRO 4000 series processors with Radeon graphics
- AMD Ryzen 5000 series processors with Radeon graphics
- AMD Ryzen 7020 series processors with Radeon graphics
- Second-generation AMD EPYC "Rome" processors
