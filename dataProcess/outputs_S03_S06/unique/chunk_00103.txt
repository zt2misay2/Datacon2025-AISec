Your organization whether it uses AI models extracted from public repositories, you determine whether it is safe. If you are uncertain, you may need to look at a new free open-source tool, which is designed to mark vulnerabilities and risks in publicly available AI models. This tool, called the AI Risk Database, was created by AI vendor Robust Intelligence in March of this year and further refined with MITRE. It was released on GitHub this week. Indiana University also participated in this collaboration. "This collaboration and the release of the AI Risk Database directly allows more organizations to see the risks and vulnerabilities they face when deploying specific types of AI systems," said Douglas Robbins, vice president of engineering and prototyping at MITRE. Representatives from the three organizations gave two speeches at Black Hat USA 2023 in Las Vegas. For more details, please check the MITRE and Robust Intelligence announcements.
Weak passwords or no passwords, as well as leaked credentials, account for about 62% of the cloud security vulnerabilities observed by the Google Cloud Event Response team in the first quarter of 2023. Enterprises affected by this "persistent challenge" can address this by strengthening their identity management tools and processes. Google stated this in its "2023 August Threat Horizon Report," which is 31 pages long. Other findings include: cybercriminals are letting seemingly legitimate Android applications pass through Google Play Store reviews, then performing unauthorized updates through unauthorized channels to add malicious features. Enterprise mitigation measures include adopting enterprise mobile management systems to create pre-approved application lists for users. According to an analysis of anonymous alert statistics from Google Chronicle Security Operations, the largest risk behavior leading to compromise is cross-project abuse of Google Cloud Platform access token generation permissions. For all details, read the complete report.
The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) hopes its newly released Cybersecurity Strategic Plan will make cybersecurity vulnerabilities rare, organizations able to withstand cyberattacks, and technology products inherently secure. These goals have not yet been achieved, but CISA hopes to reach them within the next three years. "We must clearly recognize the future we are pursuing, a future in which disruptive cyber intrusions are a shocking anomaly, organizations are secure and resilient, and technology products are inherently secure," the document states. The plan establishes three main goals: addressing direct threats, strengthening defenses, and large-scale promoting security. For all details, see the CISA announcement and complete plan document.
There is an idea about an AI-based cybersecurity product? You can win millions of dollars in a new competition. At the same time, NIST has drafted major revisions to CSF 2.0 and hopes to hear your opinion. Additionally, there is a new free tool that can mark security vulnerabilities in public AI models. Also, most cloud security vulnerabilities are caused by credential errors. There is more to come! Learn more about the six most important things to watch for this week until August 11.
The White House and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) announced this week a two-year, $20 million competition aimed at promoting the development of AI-based cybersecurity products. The AI Network Challenge (AIxCC), announced at the Black Hat USA 2023 conference in Las Vegas, attracted computer scientists, AI experts, software developers, and cybersecurity masters. The AIxCC, which was announced at the Black Hat USA 2023 conference in Las Vegas, attracted computer scientists, AI experts, software developers, and cybersecurity masters. AI vendors Anthropic, Google, Microsoft, and OpenAI will support participants by providing their technology and expertise, while the Open Source Security Foundation (OpenSSF) will serve as an advisor. Small businesses can participate in the "funding track," which will provide funding for seven small businesses. All others can participate in the "open track." After submitting proposals, up to 20 teams will be selected to participate in the semifinals in August 2024. The top five teams will receive prizes and enter the finals in August 2025 at DefCon. "If successful, AIxCC will not only produce the next generation of cybersecurity tools but also demonstrate how AI can be used to better protect critical infrastructure," said Perri Adams, AIxCC project manager at DARPA. For more details, please check the White House announcement, DARPA announcement, OpenSSF announcement, and the AIxCC website.
The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) hopes you—yes, you!—to comment on its newly released Cybersecurity Framework 2.0 draft. As a "major update" to the framework, the draft expands the scope, adds the sixth function "governance," and simplifies implementation through revised guidelines. For example, the framework originally specifically targeted protecting organizations of the U.S. critical infrastructure, but now it is aimed at covering all types of organizations worldwide, regardless of size, type, and industry. At the same time, the added "governance" function is intended to address issues related to risk management strategies, organizational context, cybersecurity supply chain risk management, and policies, procedures, and practices. The other five functions include: identify, focusing on assessing an organization's network risks; protect, about taking measures to prevent and reduce network risks; detect, focusing on discovering and analyzing network attacks and leaks; respond, dedicated to taking action after a network event occurs; recover, focusing on the recovery of affected assets and operations. "The NIST Cybersecurity Framework (Framework or CSF) 2.0 provides guidance to reduce cybersecurity risks, helping organizations understand and assess these risks, determine priorities, and communicate actions to reduce these risks," the draft document states. Would you like to share your feedback on this CSF 2.0 draft with NIST? You can send an email to [email protected] until November 4, 2023. NIST particularly hopes to know whether the draft addresses current and anticipated cybersecurity challenges and whether it aligns with established practices and guidelines. NIST expects to release the CSF 2.0 final version in early 2024, at which point it will officially replace the CSF 1.1 released in 2018. For more details, see the CSF homepage, NIST announcement, a draft summary, and the complete 52-page draft document.
On April 16, ten cybersecurity vendors set up booths at the RSA Conference 2018 Innovation Sandbox to showcase their cutting-edge technologies. These ten finalists, selected by the RSA Conference judges, covered a range of areas including deception, threat detection, network security, encryption, cloud security, and container security.
A panel of judges, consisting of venture capitalists, entrepreneurs, and industry veterans, chose BigID as the "Most Innovative Startup" in the 2018 RSA Conference Innovation Sandbox competition.
BigID CEO Dimitri Sirota expressed, "We are honored to have competed with such an outstanding group of companies and are thrilled to be awarded this prize. We believe that privacy is a 21st-century issue that all companies must take seriously, and we hope that we can help businesses alleviate the challenges of handling privacy."
Linda Gray Martin, Director and General Manager of the RSA Conference, highlighted, "The long-standing tradition of the RSAC Innovation Sandbox inspires innovation in the security industry. It's crucial for our industry to stay innovative, and it's noteworthy that these innovations no longer necessarily come from Silicon Valley. This year, we saw a record number of applications from outside California. Emerging tech hubs with growing influence in cybersecurity include Tel Aviv, Denver, and the D.C. area, and it's great to see these startups taking the stage."
"In a fiercely competitive field, BigID stood out for its unique ability to help enterprises better protect customer and employee data. We are confident that BigID will make a significant impact in the cybersecurity industry over the next few years."
