<My data is an asset. Let's share some best practices for protecting data>
<If you feel security is a constraint>
<then it's time to rethink>
<In this blog post>
<I will share 5 simple rules>
<that can be easily implemented>
<to securely protect your backups through the "object storage standard-S3 API" class of storage>
<I am a DevOps or DevSecOps>
<developing on my own platform>
<and focusing on what I can add value to the business>
<That's why I manage infrastructure deployment and expansion through code>
<I delegate infrastructure management to my cloud service provider>
<While developing the business>
<my data volume has been growing exponentially>
<so my data also has value>
<As the business grows>
<I collect more data>
<and save historical datasets year by year>
<I even deploy globally in new locations>
<All this data (applications, user data, logs, media, analysis, reports) is stored and backed up in object storage to achieve flexibility, metadata search, and easy scalability>
<My data in my hands represents a huge asset>
<Data drives my business>
<I want to protect it>
<Data is an important asset that needs good governance>
<Don't think "Cool, I have copied my data to a secondary storage bucket>
<my backup is done>
<I'm safe">
<No, that's not enough>
<S3 object storage cannot protect you from yourself>
<Let's look at the three types of risks we need to prevent>
<(1) The biggest cause of data loss is human error, accidental deletion, or overwriting objects with garbage data>
<This is the scenario you want to avoid>
<(2) The second type of risk is related to unpredictable events: software issues, hardware issues (disk failure), data center outages or natural disasters/human disasters>
<(3) The third type of risk is what security experts can't sleep on — malicious behavior: malware, ransomware and viruses, destructive behavior, DDoS……>
<Security is very important and non-negotiable>
<Let's look at 5 simple rules to prevent these risks>
<Rule 1 – Version control>
<Version control helps prevent accidental overwriting>
<You can recover a version after an accidental deletion or retrieve a specific version if the data is damaged>
<Rule 2 – Immutability>
<When your main storage system must be open and available>
<your backup data should be isolated and immutable>
<Use the S3 object lock API to implement a write-once-read-many (WORM) model>
<You can define different parameters based on your needs, business, and data type: retention period, legal mode, governance mode, compliance mode>
<This rule helps your organization comply with compliance requirements>
<To retain logs within the required legal period "compliance mode">
<will help you set the required period>
<This is very convenient because logs are generated every second>
<so it's difficult to track>
<With compliance mode>
<you no longer need to worry about this>
<you can set a period of one year, three years, or five years>
<logs will be protected during the specified period>
<Rule 3 – 异地 data replication>
<To prevent the impact of hardware failures or geographical events>
<follow the famous 3+2+1 model>
<Before setting up data copies>
<you need to evaluate the RPO and RTO of the target>
<RPO (Recovery Point Objective) = What point in time snapshot is acceptable to you in the event of a geographical failure>
<so that the least data is lost when recovering data>
<RTO (Recovery Time Objective) = What is the acceptable time to recover data in the event of a geographical failure>
<Of course, everyone hopes to achieve zero-second recovery>
<but is this necessary?>
<Such a recovery plan requires expensive resources to maintain>
<A good suggestion is to classify data by importance category and adjust this plan and backup retention policy accordingly>
<Rule 4 – Encryption>
<When your data is not in use>
<you can encrypt it with your own key>
<We use features based on the AES-256 protocol>
<Encrypt your data: use your own key and encryption based on AES-256>
<Please note that during transmission>
<data is encrypted through the TLS protocol>
<Rule 5 – User policies>
<Only grant permissions needed to perform tasks>
<Use user policies for bucket policies (which will be launched)>
<Extract your S3 policies monthly and check them>
<This will not take much time and can be automated>
<Ensure you know all users and that permissions are appropriate for each role>
<Never let a wildcard * provide access to sensitive buckets/objects>

<Regarding the local Kaseya VSA>
<you need to know that it is an IT remote monitoring and management (RMM) solution>
<used by IT and network administrators to install and patch software on enterprise computing devices>
<manage backups>
<automate other IT processes>
<and remotely resolve and troubleshoot IT issues>
<Such tools require a software agent with elevated permissions to run on each computing device>
<In this attack>
<the individual agents on each computing device were not exploited>
<instead>
<two or more servers running the VSA software were compromised>
<and then instructed the agents to install and run malicious software>
<Kaseya SaaS was not compromised>
<it is like Kaseya VSA>
<it depends on the agent running on each computing device>
<However>
<the Kaseya SaaS agent is guided by Kaseya's cloud>
<and it seems these customers were not affected by this attack>

<Executives should understand how to mitigate the risks of such cyber attacks>
<When you read and listen to the details of this attack>
<you will hear about SQL injection and authentication bypass>
<These are just means that led to the unfortunate results>
<Regardless of the method>
<the attacker will seize your critical applications in your infrastructure and use it against you>
<There is a class of security control measures that every enterprise should fully use: containment and isolation>
<Containment limits the high-risk applications to what the rest of the endpoint can do>
<Isolation limits the rest of the endpoint to what it can do or get from the same host>
<In this attack>
<when the compromised Kaseya VSA application tried to write to places it should not write to>
<containment controls would block these operations in real time>
<In this attack>
<a zero-day vulnerability was exploited to compromise the Kaseya VSA application>
<Or>
<the other scenario that did not happen>
<was that another application had been compromised and used to inject malicious code into the Kaseya VSA application>
<Isolation controls can prevent this technique>
<Another way to achieve the same protective effect>
<is to use an application control tool that enforces certain read/write rules during pre-execution and execution>
<"peri-" means it enforces certain read/write rules on applications like Kaseya VSA during execution>
<Unfortunately>
<for most network tools that can perform this function>
<the rule sets may be very complex and difficult to create and maintain>
<because these fine-grained rules must change as the applications change over time>
<Few enterprises (less than 5%, perhaps even less than 1%) implement application control tools during execution>
<because they add a burden to daily operations>

<AppGuard could have protected the victims from the compromised Kaseya VSA software>
<AppGuard broke the code to add strong protection while avoiding the difficulties of execution-time application control>
<No vendor can make containment and isolation security controls as easy to implement and maintain or as effective as AppGuard>
<As was found in the SolarWinds supply chain attack>
<the Microsoft Exchange Server Proxylogon attack>
<and many other major headline malware attacks in the past year>
<AppGuard was found to be the key difference between victims and winners>

<AppGuard's approach may be very different from what you are familiar with>
<it neutralizes attacks by blocking operations that are not allowed>
<without identifying malware>
